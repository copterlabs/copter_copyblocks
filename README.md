Copter Copy Blocks — A WordPress Plugin
=======================================

This WordPress plugin allows users to create copy blocks that are embedded 
into posts with a corresponding shortcode.

The aim is to eliminate the need for editing multiple posts and/or pages when 
common text needs to change, such as a marketing blurb, without requiring a 
developer to be involved.


Installation
------------

Download a copy of the copter_copyblocks plugin.

In your WordPress installation, place the copter_copyblocks plugin in the 
`wp-content/plugins/` directory.

Log into your WordPress Dashboard and click the "Plugins" option in the 
left-hand menu.

Click "Activate" under the "Copter Copy Blocks" plugin.

All done!
