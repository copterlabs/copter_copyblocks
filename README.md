Copter Copy Blocks — A WordPress Plugin
=======================================

This WordPress plugin allows users to create copy blocks that are embedded 
into posts with a corresponding shortcode.

The aim is to eliminate the need for editing multiple posts and/or pages when 
common text needs to change, such as a marketing blurb, without requiring a 
developer to be involved.
